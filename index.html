            <p>In Bangladesh, six seasons with their distinctive robes come in procession, play and depart. Through
                there is
                intense heat in summer, there are the gifts of delicious fruits. Though there are floods during the
                rainy
                season. It is the season that blesses us with greenery, in autumn there is the game of hiding and seeks
                among the clouds, the blue sky and enchanting moonlight at night. In winter fields full of winter crops
                and
                golden paddy, ready for reaping, present a panoramic view. </p>
